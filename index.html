        <p>Maori protests throughout NZ</p>

        <p>It has been a shocking day at New Zealand as Maori protestants have been rummaging the streets, asking for their language back.  They hold signs saying "It's a right we don't have to beg" as police are still trying to handle them</p>

        <p>On the Maoris behalf, the government has decided to debate on the current status. As Smith Jackson says "They are all but just disrupting". At the same time Tohu Nikau has a whole different perspective. He says that "This is our language that you have taken away from us, and we shall never let go of."</p>
