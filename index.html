        <p>Maori protests throughout NZ</p>

        <p>Maori protesters have been rummaging through the streets of New Zealand on a shocking day, demanding that their language be restored.As the police continue to try to deal with them, they are holding signs that read, "It's a right we don't have to beg for."</p>

        
        
        
        <p>The government has decided to debate the current situation on behalf of the Maori people.According to Smith Jackson, "They are essentially just disrupting."Tohu Nikau, on the other hand, has a completely different point of view."This is our language you have taken away from us, and we shall never let go of," he declares.</p>
